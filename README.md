# Sanjana's Movie Recommendation Tool!

In this project, I am building a movie recommendation tool!

### Inspiration!
The phrase “decision fatigue” is unanimously associated with Netflix. My sister and I love watching movies together, but we always spend over 30 minutes trying to pick something to watch. To solve this, I created a Movie Recommendation Tool, a project designed to simplify movie nights by using data-driven suggestions to narrow down our choices. The goal is to reduce the time spent deciding and spend more time actually enjoying the movie.

### Programming Tools Used
* Python
